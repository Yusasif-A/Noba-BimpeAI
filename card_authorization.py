"""
Card authorizations, and the rules that decide whether one is suspicious.

WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM bank_api
A pending authorization is not a booked transaction. The card network has asked
"may this go through?" and the bank has not yet answered, so it must not appear
in a statement as money that moved. `bank_api` owns settled history; this owns
the in-flight moment, and the dashboard shows the two together with the pending
one clearly marked.

That distinction is the whole point of the demo. A fraud agent that rings you
after the money is gone is a receipt. One that rings you while the authorization
is still held can actually stop it -- so a freeze here declines a payment that
had not yet completed.

State is in-process and dies with the server, like the verification sessions in
bimpe_tools. Same reasoning: a pending authorization that silently survives a
restart would be a payment nobody is holding open any more.
